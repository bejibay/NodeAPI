# NodeAPI
* NodeAPI contains APIs built with JavaScript, Nodejs, ExpressJs, MongoDB, 
and MYSQL
* The APIs use different storage media such as:
virtual memmory, mysql and mongodb
*The nosql mongodb storage is effected with both
mongodb driver(mongodb folder) and mongoose model
(mongoose folder)

## Scripts
* index.js
* memory/index.js
* mysql/index.js
* mongodb/index.js
* mongoose/index.js

## Applications
* It is a common feature to build APIs which are
used as endpoints in web applications. HTTP requests 
using different HTTP verbs are sent to the APIs.
